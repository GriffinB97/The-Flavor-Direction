### With my account, I want to browse a variety of built-in recipes, create and save my own unique recipes, and have all my data securely stored in a database for future access. 
### Additionally, I would like the app to eventually include features that allow me to interact more with the community, such as sharing recipes with other users and leaving comments on their creations. 
### This way, I can continuously find inspiration and contribute to a growing culinary community.
